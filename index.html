                    At some point in their life, the Hunter becomes afflicted with an unspecified disease and travels to Yharnam, an ancient city known for housing an old medical remedy which is said to cure any disease. Iosefka calls the Hunter "paleblood", and, in one of her notes, mentions the need to find a paleblood to "transcend the hunt."

                    Gehrman was the founder of the Workshop, an institution designed to combat the beasts caused by blood usage. His Burial Blade is a masterpiece, crafted at the workshop. It is forged of siderite, a mineral said to have fallen from the heavens. Gehrman’s clothing existed before the workshop, and was created by making adjustments to everyday clothing. It later became the basis for all hunter’s garb. The attire was adjusted to be lightweight, allowing engagement with beasts at speed.

This bell’s ring resonates across worlds, and Gehrman used it as a special signal to call hunters from other worlds to cross the gap and co-operate. The scholars of Byrgenwerth discovered special blood in the tombs. This discovery made their dreams of evolution a reality, but its use led to metamorphosis into beasts. Gehrman trained the first hunters as students or apprentices. Among those students was Lady Maria. Maria had great admiration for Gehrman, and Gehrman in turn was possessed of a “curious mania” towards her. Evidently Gehrman loved Maria, but whether the feelings were reciprocated, or even known about, is unclear.</p>

                    The Doll was tenderly made by Gehrman as a means to keep him company and to also to serve the many hunters that would come to the Hunter's Dream.

                    The Doll is based on a student which Gehrman held affections to, Lady Maria. After Maria's disappearance, Gehrman sought to obsessively replicate her in the form of the Doll. The Doll herself has exactly the same size and appearance as Maria, as well as the same voice. However, Gehrman soon became indifferent towards the Doll's presence, possibly due to the latter lacking Maria's personality.

                        The Doll is very loyal to the Hunter. She accepts her role to serve, believing it to be her purpose. This is seen in all endings, as she serves the Hunter in some way or wishes the Hunter well.

However, she was one of the first hunters to join the nightly hunt, studying under Gehrman, the First Hunter. Despite being a citizen of Cainhurst, who relished in their extravagant uses of blood, she favored her Rakuyo, which required dexterity and skill rather than blood to wield effectively.
                            At an unknown point in time, Maria forfeited her beloved weapon, tossing it down a well when she could no longer stomach it, and seemingly killed herself. Her consciousness was then pulled into the Hunter's Nightmare.
                            Gehrman held a curious mania about her, even after she disappeared. The Doll was based on her, down to her facial features, yet, sadly, lacked her personality, leaving Gehrman bitter.

                            Iosefka is a kind and compassionate blood-healer who runs Iosefka's Clinic. Initially, she is very caring, expressing her concern to protect her patients from outsiders and, despite her sympathy for the Hunter, will refuse to let them enter in fear of infection. She can be spoken to at the door near the 1st Floor Sickroom Lamp. If her door is attacked, she will ask the Hunter to stop. After several attacks, she will not speak to the Hunter at all.

                            Iosefka will supply the Hunter with a Iosefka’s Blood Vial, as a way to help with the hunt. If the Hunter uses enough of her vials, she will state that she hopes to open the door once the hunt is over.

                                    After defeating Father Gascoigne and visiting her once again, a sudden shift in tone will commence and Iosefka begins acting suspiciously; her voice changes slightly, and she asks the Hunter to send any encountered survivors to her clinic, a complete contrast in character to previously forbidding anyone to enter.
